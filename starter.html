      <h2>
        The Space Race was an informal competition between the United States
        and the Soviet Union to see who could make the furthest advancements
        into space first. It involved the efforts to explore outer space with
        artificial satellites, to send man into space, and to land him on the
        Moon.

            more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
            new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
            intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.

                    Geophysical Year and in response to the launch of the Soviet
                    satellite Sputnik 1. It was the first spacecraft to recognize the
                    Van Allen radiation belt, although Sputnik 2 detected it earlier.

                    Lunokhod 1 (Луноход, moon walker in Russian) was the first of two
                    unmanned lunar rovers landed on the Moon by the Soviet Union as
                    part of its Lunokhod program. The spacecraft which carried
                    Lunokhod 1 was named Luna 17. Lunokhod was the first roving
                    remote-controlled robot to land on another celestial body.

                  <p>
                    Luna 17 was launched on November 10, 1970 at 14:44:01 UTC. After
                    reaching earth parking orbit, the final stage of Luna 17's
                    launching rocket fired to place it into a trajectory towards the
                    Moon (1970-11-10 at 14:54 UTC). After two course correction
                    maneuvers (on November 12 and 14), it entered lunar orbit on
                    November 15, 1970 at 22:00 UTC.

                  <h2>End of the Space Race</h2>
                  <p>
                    The 17 July 1975 rendezvous of the Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft
                    traditionally marks the end of the Space Race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the Sputnik 1 launch can clearly be called the start of the
                    Space Race, its end is more debatable. Most hotly contested during
                    the 1960s, the Space Race continued apace through the U.S. Apollo
                    moon landing of 1969. Although they followed Apollo 11 with five
                    more manned lunar landings, American space scientists turned to
                    new arenas. Skylab was to gather data, and the Space Shuttle was
                    intended to return spaceships intact from space journeys.
